These are Python solutions to the Java problems from CodingBat.  I've made these because only a small subset of the
Java problem sets were adapted to Python, and I think many of those excluded problem sets are just as good a
learning experience in Python as they are in Java.

Where the Python and Java problem sets overlap, I use snake_case function names instead of camelCase function names.
Some solution sets, like String-2 or Array-2, will have both snake_case and camelCase function names in them.
My solutions do not use any imports, and should be fully inline with the rules of CodingBat.  The author of CodingBat
likes to use built in names for function arguments like "def some_func(str, len):".  Since I'm trying to mimic the
problems as closely as possible, I'm using the same argument names, in-spite of that being bad practice.

My solutions should include the public test cases for each problem, if they don't, let me know.
