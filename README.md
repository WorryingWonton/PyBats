These are Python solutions to the Java problems from CodingBat.  Where the Python and Java problem sets overlap, these are
also the Python solutions for CodingBat.  I've made these because only a small subset of the Java problem sets were adapted
to Python, and I think many of those excluded problem sets are just as good a learning experience in Python as they are in Java.

My solutions should include the public test cases for each problem, if they don't, let me know, and I'll add them.
At the time of writing this, I have the finished solution sets for Logic-2, Array-3, Map-2, and Recursion-2.  My goal
is to eventually add every problem, but this might take a while.
